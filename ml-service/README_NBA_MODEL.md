```bash
# Start the enhanced NBA prediction API
PORT=5001 python3 app.py

# Or run the full analysis pipeline
python3 nba_advanced_predictor.py
```

### Configuration
Set environment variables:
```bash
export SPRING_BOOT_URL="http://localhost:8080"  # Your backend API
export PORT=5001                                # API port
